        <h2>Trades</h2>
        <p>
            - PLEASE DO NOT TAPE THE SLEEVE (top loader is okay) <br>
            - packaged in penny sleeve, top loader, makeshift card (will expect you to do the same) <br>
            - if you have less than 15 proofs I will ask you to send first (this means you send first, and I send once I receive yours) <br>
            - international is stamped shipping only <br>
            - if you do tape the sleeve, you will be posted
        </p>

        <h2>Sales</h2>
        <p>
            - packaged same as trades <br>
            - shipping is $1 for pcs unless otherwise stated in post (if it says $x shipped/stamped it means shipping is included in the price)<br>
            - for fancy shipping or albums shipping is $5.50+ (depends on weight and size) <br>
            - international stamped shipping is $3 (pcs only) <br>
            - I am open to negotiation on prices but usually I list it as low as possible/under what I paid, so don't expect much

    <div style="background-color: #9ad2c7;" class="hidden card" id="goInfo">
        <h2>Group Orders</h2>
        <p>
            - I tend to just close the set and cover it myself so most of the time if I post it at least the 1st set is guaranteed <br>
            - my GOs are open to WW, but prefer USA and non-USA is pob only, shipping will be more <br>
            - If you are looking to by the physical album (USA ONLY), just lmk or I'm gonna assume pob only <br>
            - I may use my friend's kaddress (assume I do, unless stated in post or one-payment GOs) <br>
            - will be either one or two payments (one if ems+dms+initial, two = initial, ems+dms) <br>
            - forgive me if I may be a bit slow at giving updates <br>
            - not super strict on payments, but I will not send you your items until they are fully paid for <br>
            - if you'd rather pay initial + ems + dms in one payment later/forget to pay, you get 2 weeks to pay from 
            when I send out the totals before I drop your claims and resell them
